# Projects for Applied Machine Learning:

## Project 1: White Wine Quality Prediction  

  ### Description:  
  This project uses ML models from built from scratch in PyTorch to predict the quality of white wine based on its chemical attributes. It includes
  data visualization, model training using gradient descent, and evaluationby cross-validation.

  ### Features:  
  - Data visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for summaries and visualizations including heatmaps, histograms, violin plots, and joint plots to explore feature correlations
  - Gradient descent from scratch to train linear, multi-linear, and non-linear models with epoch training
  - 5 fold cross-validation to assess model generalization
    1. **Linear Regression** – using only alcohol as input  
2. **Multi-linear Regression** – using multiple normalized features  
3. **Non-linear Regression** – includes feature interactions
